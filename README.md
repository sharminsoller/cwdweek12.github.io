# Deck of Cards

## Introduction
Anyone up for a game of 52 card pickup?

## Objective
For this assignment you will demonstrate your skills of HTML Creation and Event Delegation with JavaScript, by generating all 52 cards in a standard deck and adding functionality to make the cards "flippable". 

## Requirements 

1. Download the [Deck of Cards Starter Files](https://github.com/MTM6230/deck-of-cards/archive/master.zip). The starter files contain an `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, an `index.js` file, and an `images` folder. **All changes for this assignment will be made to the `index.js` file.**
2. Using the provided arrays and card template, create all 52 cards of a standard deck and insert them into the deck container.
3. Using the Event Delegation technique, add the functionality that will toggle the class `flipped` on a card when a card is clicked. **Note: You need to use the [`closest()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)** 
5. Submit the `index.js` file to the **Deck of Cards** assignment on Brightspace.
